            <h3><a href="https://atriumhealth.org/">Atrium Health</a></h3>
            <br>
        <p>
            The purpose of Atrium Health. To improve health, elevate hope and advance healing for all. 
            "Health. Hope. Healing. For all. Five simple but powerful words. This is our promise to you".
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            Constrast: While looking over the website of Atrium Health, three main colors are used. These colors are teal(which is the mostly used), white, and black. 
            The constrast of these colors allow the users or viewers to recognize the amount of information that is viewed on the page. 
            These colors project the viewer to certain categories which will help them navigate through the page.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Repetition: All the colors, fonts, and size are consistent on the page. On the infomational pages, the sizes of the titles are the same. 
            This allows the user to know thats the title. Body paragraphs are sizes and fonts are consistent as well. The teal color is very persistent on each page. 
            This represents Atrium Health brand color.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Alignment: On each page, the alignment of pictures, paragraphs, slides, and even navigation bars are all lined up horizontally.
            The border is centered around all of the body text on each page. Everything is centered and well portioned to the point where the viewer can easily
            read the information shown.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Proximity: The design elements of the pictures and slides are very well spaced-out. The design elements of the slides are 
            grouped into smaller pictures with links and bits of information that are spaced out evenly between each other. 
            They are portionally placed where the user can immediately tell the difference between the pictures and it will create user interaction.

            <h3><a href="https://acphd.org/health-alerts/">Alameda County Public Health Department</a></h3>
            <br>
        <p>
            The Alameda County Public Health Department is an health department that helps to protect the citizens and residents of the county.
            The Alameda County Public Health Department delivers a good amount of things. These things are disease prevention and control, community mobilization and outreach, 
            policy development, education, and access to medical and health care services.
        </p>

        <ul>

        <li>
            Constrast: There are a lot of colors used on this site that is used. These colors are white, light blue, red, yellow, grey, and black. 
            The constrast on multiple pages seem a little too much which gives the user problems with viewing the screen for a specific amount of time.
            A different color contrast should have been used to help the user better navigate through the page.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Repetition: Even though there is a lot of colors and fonts sizes used they are very repetitve throught each page.
            Each title font is used in red color and the font is the same as well. Also, the font size as well. 
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Alignment: The alignment of some pages are inconsistent. On a few pages, the body paragraphs, design elements, and somewhat unportioned.
            For example, on the homepage there is design elements, informational links, pictures, and much more are kinda unportioned. 
            Its not too bad, but there needs to be some adjustments. It seems the idea of the design elements and information was supposed to be centered, but not all are.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Proximity: The information on this site is seemed to be very closed together. On each page, there is a clump of information or pictures with links that are close together.
            There needs to be a good amount of space that will allow the user to be able to naviagte through the site. The site isn't completely bad there has to be changes made.
        </li>
        
        </ul>
