                I work for my own family company, which is called Conquer Security Services Inc. This is a security company that does on site security for different business corporations. My job is basically like a manager and IT person. I'm in charge of maintaining the company website and updating any new or old information as well.

                My first programming language i learned was HTML and then a little of CSS. That was in high school where I learned how to build a website from scratch using C++. Now, in college I use mostly JAVA.I'm taking four classes this fall semester of 2022. The classes I'm taking is Intro to Computer Networks, Human Centered Design, Web App Design and Development.

                ITIS-3135-091 Web app Design and Development. Reason for taking this course is to fulfill one of my core requirements. Also, to refresh my memory with HTML and web development.ITCS-3166-001-Intro to Computer Networks, ITIS-3130-051-Human-Centered Design, ITIS-3135-091-Web App Design and Development are core classes that I need to go towards my BA degree. ITIS-3200-001-Intro to Info Security & Privacy is a elective class that will satisfy one of ITIS electives. Also, wanted this class so I can learn about Cyber Security.
