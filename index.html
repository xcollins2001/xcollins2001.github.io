                I work for my own family company, which is called Conquer Security Services Inc. This is a security company that does on site security for different business corporations. My job is basically like a manager and IT person. I'm in charge of maintaining the company website and updating any new or old information as well.

                I spent my first two years in college at Central Piedmont Community College where I got an Associates in Arts in computer science. Now I've spent the last remaining years at UNC at Charlotte to earn my Bachelors of Arts in computer Science. Furthermore, I'm currently a senior with a GPA of a 3.2.

                My first programming language i learned was HTML and then a little of CSS. That was in high school where I learned how to build a website from scratch using C++. Now, in college I use mostly JAVA.I'm taking four classes this fall semester of 2022. The classes I'm taking is Intro to Computer Networks, Human Centered Design, Web App Design and Development.

                ITIS-3135-091 Web app Design and Development. Reason for taking this course is to fulfill one of my core requirements. Also, to refresh my memory with HTML and web development.ITCS-3166-001-Intro to Computer Networks, ITIS-3130-051-Human-Centered Design, ITIS-3135-091-Web App Design and Development are core classes that I need to go towards my BA degree. ITIS-3200-001-Intro to Info Security & Privacy is a elective class that will satisfy one of ITIS electives. Also, wanted this class so I can learn about Cyber Security.

I took a picture with him when I was 14 years old.I am not from North Carolina. I am a brother of the best fraternity in the world which is called Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc.
